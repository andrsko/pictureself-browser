A pictureself consists of customizable layers represented through features.
For example, "face shape" + "mouth" + "nose" + "eyes" + "eyebrows" + "glasses" + "hair" + "hat".
Feature can have different implementations - variants: "face shape" - ["round", "oval", "square" etc.], "eyes" - ["brown","blue","green" etc.] 
Implementation depends on customization performed by user.
So if user choses "face shape" as "square" and "eyes" as "green" pictureself will be composed as follows ["r" - for random customization]:
square face shape layer -> r mouse layer -> r nose layer -> green eyes layer -> r eyebrows layer -> r glasses layer -> r hair layer -> r hat layer.
Including feature in different pictureselfs(surprised, angry, happy etc.) means different implementation with the same customization. 
Thus when user for "eyes" feature have already chosen "green" - 
in pictureself responding, for example, to surprised state - customization remains - eyes would be green but widened.
That means that creator includes feature and provides responding variants in the same order: for eyes that would be brown widened, blue widened, green widened.
In general, feature is just an index of variant chosen by user. So if user chooses green that means that whenever this feature is included in other pictureselfs
for this particular user variant number 3 would be displayed.
If implementation of included feature should be the same as in original pictureself "import variants" checkbox lets import corresponding images.
